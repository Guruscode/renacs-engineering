                <h2>What We Do </h2>
                <p>RENL has the capability to act as the final stage in the delivery of electricity to end users. We believe that we can play a pivotal role in delivering competitive energy supply. We are committed to working with customers to ensure that we provide a service that fits in with their specific needs. RENL undertakes marketing campaigns in order to:
                <b><br>   1. Acquire new customers
                    <br>  2. Provide services to existing customers
                    <br>  3. Promote awareness of our brand
                    <br>  4. Compete with other suppliers </b>

              <p> RENL will ensure that all of the sales or marketing agents who work for us are trained to a high standard and clearly understand the following information:
            <b><br>• The arrangements for competition in the market.

                    The key to all electrification projects is the power source.
                      RENL can provide base load or standby power stations in diesel, mini hydro, wind power and solar power.<br>
                The provision of electricity to remote communities or smaller urban population is the key to development and industrialization, but more importantly it adds to the quality of life and leads to improvements in education and health.
                As the cost of the supply of electricity by transmission to remote region is generally prohibitive, unless a suitable line passes in very close proximity to the area, the only practical proposition for the provision of power is by generation in the area itself.
                In some cases, bulk supplies of power may be brought to or pass through the electrification project region at high transmission voltages and consequently, the voltage must be reduced to a usable level for the project.  In these circumstances, a voltage reducing substation will be required and RENL can provide the entire installation, from take off at the bulk supply point, to output to the transmission line or distribution network.
              <br>   RENL. is able to undertake indoor or outdoor substations and switchyards for the full range of incoming voltage up to a maximum of 330KV and reduce this to any voltage level to meet the project requirements.
                RENACS ENGINEERING NIGERIA LIMITED has successfully completed the Urban Electrification of some of the most difficult areas, and by so doing, confirmed its ability in this field.
                Urban electrification can take several forms but in principle, it is the provision of power and street lighting to houses, commercial premises and factories in densely populated area.
                <br>RENACS ENGINEERING NIGERIA LIMITED is also specialized in the implementation of electrification contracts for rural communities, whether they are extensions to existing networks or complete backbone or development networks, based upon island site generation or derived from established distribution.
                Whether the project is a conceptual requirement of a local authority or government or prepared scheme, R.E.N. has the ability to undertake the complete turnkey contract.

                One of the problems facing most developing countries is the provision of good roads at affordable costs;
                <br>  In Nigeria and particularly since the turn of the century, the priority on road construction and or rehabilitation has become more pressing than ever before.  Any method of providing good roads at affordable costs is paramount to the development of any nation.
              <br>  RENL introduced the first alternative method for building and rehabilitating roads with the use of Ionic soil stabilizer ISS 2500.  ISS 2500 as the name implies is used in stabilizing soils in problematic areas to allow for a variety of uses on the land in question. ISS 2500 chemically alters the constitution of the soil thereby making room for better bonding between soil particles.  The result is you have better compaction and the soil is impervious to water.
                ISS 2500 offers an economical alternative construction method for roads, high-ways, dam stabilization, farm road, parking areas, air field, erosion control and water proofing.
